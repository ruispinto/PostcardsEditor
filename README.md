# PostcardsEditor

This release of Postcards Editor is open source. You just need to modify the settings on the connection_class file.
It is a working release (version 2) of my personnal editor. Allows modifications in a local or remote database.
You can view a postcard collection using mysql database. All database structure will be added in the future.
